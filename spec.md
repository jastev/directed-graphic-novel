# Theme - The Directed Graphic Novel

A "directed graphic novel" is a story where the reader must make choices at the
end of each page - the plot is thus different depending upon the choices made.
These thus form a directed graph, where the pages are vertices in the graph and
the choices are edges (a given page may not have the option to reverse the
previous choice, hence the following page must have a choice to return if this
is to be available to the reader, and thus the graph is directed).

Each implementation represents a library of such novels.  Users must be able
to create their own stories, and keep them private while in draft.  Once
published, other users should be able to see the novel in the library index
and read it.

The range of requirements are intended to be rich enough to be interesting, and
expose distinguishing features of each implementation.  In the interests of 
minimizing unnecessary complexity, however, some features that seem natural to
the domain (e.g. managing user identity and permissions) are absent.
